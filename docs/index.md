OpinHelpers is a bellow "Swiss Army Knife" level set of opinionated Helper libs (hence the [opin[h]el](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinel_knife)^^) covering some of the most annoying aspects of php programing, such as UTF8 string manipulation, arbitrary precision Mathematics or properly locking a file.

OpinHelpers libs are opinionated in several ways and do not aim at being universal, but they should hopefully be pretty useful in many IRL cases.

## Installation

OpinHelpers can be installed using composer :

```
composer require "fab2s/opinhelpers"
```

## Requirements

OpinHelpers is tested against php 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 and hhvm.
